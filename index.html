        <h3> 3 Scientific Benefits of Being a Cat Owner</h3>
        <p> 1. OWNING A CAT IS BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.
            If you're worried about your carbon footprint, it’s better to own a cat than a dog. A 2009 study found that
            the resources needed to feed a dog over the course of its life create the same eco-footprint as that of a
            Land Cruiser. Meanwhile, cats—which eat less in general and are more likely to eat fish than corn- or
            beef-flavored products—only have the approximate carbon footprint of a small hatchback.</p>
        <p>2. YOU'LL HAVE A HEALTHIER HEART.
            Cats in particular lower your stress level—possibly since they don’t require as much effort as dogs—and
            lower the amount of anxiety in your life. Petting a cat has a positive calming effect. One study found that
            over a 10-year period cat owners were 30 percent less likely to die of a heart attack or stroke than non-cat
            owners (although this might just be because cat owners are more relaxed and have lower stress in general).
        </p>
        <p> 3.THEY CAN QUITE LITERALLY SAVE YOUR LIFE.
            Cats have a reputation of being aloof and not caring about their humans, but they have saved countless lives
            over the years. One cat in the United Kingdom warns her human when he’s about to have an epileptic seizure,
            while a cat in Montana woke up its two humans when a gas pipe started leaking. Firefighters told the couple
            that the house could easily have exploded if not for cat’s intervention.
            One cat has even received the highest medal available to military animals. Simon the cat was onboard the HMS
            Amethyst, which was sailing up the Yangtze in 1949 when a shell hit the ship, killing several marines and
            severely injuring Simon. (The event marked the beginning of the 101-day siege of the ship, which would
            become known as the Yangtze Incident.) Simon was fixed up, and despite being injured, performed his ship
            duty and started catching the rats that were threatening the ship’s food supply, as well as providing moral
            support for the surviving sailors. Simon died not long after the ship returned to the UK, but he was
            posthumously awarded the UK’s Dickin Medal, recognized as the animal Victoria Cross, for "behaviour [of] the
            highest order, although the blast was capable of making a hole over a foot in diameter in a steel plate."

        <h3> 3 Scientific Benefits of Being a dog Owner</h3>
        <p>1. DOGS MAKE US FEEL LESS ALONE .
            Dogs can be there for you even when people can’t. They offer unconditional love, emotional support, and
            constant cuddles that help stave off social isolation. A small Australian study discovered that dog
            ownership reduces loneliness.

            A national survey of pet owners and non-pet owners by the Human Animal Bond Research Institute found that 85
            percent of respondents believe that interaction with pets reduces loneliness. Most agree that human-pet
            interactions can help address social isolation.</p>
        <p> 2. DOGS ARE GOOD FOR YOUR HEART.
            Owning a dog can help you live longer. A comprehensive review of studies published between 1950 and 2019
            found that dog owners had a lower risk of death. Studies suggest that dog owners have lower blood pressure
            levels and improved responses to stress.

            Even just living with a dog makes a difference—people who had experienced previous coronary events had an
            even higher level of risk reduction for death. Research has concluded that the bond between humans and dogs
            reduces stress, which is a major cause of cardiovascular problems.</p>
        <p> 3. DOGS ENCOURAGE YOU TO MOVE .
            Those long treks along sidewalks, trails, and paths add up. A 2019 British study discovered that dog owners
            are nearly four times more likely than non-dog owners to meet daily physical activity guidelines. Dog owners
            spend nearly 300 minutes every week walking with their dogs. That’s 200 more minutes walking than people
            without a pup of their own.</p>
